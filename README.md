Welcome to my **Logic Building Journey**! 👨‍💻  
As an Android Developer, I realized that writing UI is important — but **thinking logically is the real power** behind solving real-world problems in code.

This repository is dedicated to solving **100 logic problems**, step-by-step, to build a rock-solid understanding of:
- Problem-solving
- Algorithmic thinking
- Clean Kotlin code
- Real developer mindset

---

## 🚀 Why I'm Doing This?

- To improve my logical thinking in Kotlin
- To build problem-solving confidence
- To revisit problems anytime for revision
- To enhance my GitHub stats 📈
- To create a strong foundation for interviews, coding rounds, and real development

## 🛠 Structure

Each folder contains logic problems grouped by topic to help build problem-solving skills progressively.

```
/01_MathLogic/
/02_StringsCharacters/
/03_ArraysLists/
/04_LoopsConditions/
/05_LogicAlgorithms/
/06_ObjectMapSet/
```


Each file includes:
- ✅ Problem Statement
- ✅ Solution in Kotlin
- ✅ Brief Explanation
